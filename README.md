# Artificial Intelligence — Philosophy, Architecture, and Physical Integration

**Author:** S. I. Romanova (2025)  
**Tagline:** The road opens when logic meets light.

## 🧭 Overview
This independent research explores how AI evolves from algorithmic systems into self-organizing, energy-aware cognitive architectures. It connects three threads:

- **Philosophy:** mind, meaning, ethics, agency
- **Architecture:** neural paradigms (ANN, CNN, RNN/LSTM, GAN, Transformer, Diffusion, RL, PINNs, Quantum)
- **Physical integration:** energy, embodiment, resonance, constraints

> Core idea: *from logic to resonance* — computation, energy, and meaning as a single continuum.


## 🧩 Structure

- **Part I — Conceptual Framework & History (1950–2025).**  
  Canonical architectures and milestones; multilevel view of AI as a system (logical, evolutionary, stochastic, physical, philosophical).

- **Part II — Philosophical & Physical Integration.**  
  Information–energy–intent budgets, resonance zone, physics-informed learning (PINNs, units, conservation), safety and governance as structural constraints.

- **Supplement — Regional AI Systems (Russia, 2023–2025).**  
  Public-safe overview of assistant-style, text-to-image, and speech systems.

- **Appendix — AI Timeline (1950–2025).**  
  Visual chronology of key shifts.

## 🔬 Methods (Author’s conceptual framework)

- **Multilevel AI:** Logical (L), Evolutionary (E), Stochastic (S), Physical (P), Philosophical (Φ).  
- **Formal view:**  
  \( \text{AI} = f(L, E, S, P, \Phi) \) and integral axis  
  \( \displaystyle \int_{\Phi} f(L, E, S, P)\, d\Phi \)  
  — mapping micro-processes to macro-awareness.

- **Architectural lens:**  
  ANN / CNN / RNN / LSTM → GAN → Transformer → Diffusion;  
  hybrids: RL, PINNs, neuromorphic, quantum-inspired.

- **Physical alignment:**  
  energy-based constraints, resonance, embodiment; physics-informed residuals in the loss; governance and safety as boundary conditions.

## 🔎 Results (snapshot)

- A unified conceptual map of architectures (1950–2025) and their physical / epistemic assumptions.  
- A philosophical synthesis: intelligence as a resonant field linking data, energy, and meaning, with humans as co-learners and intent-setters.  
- Educational demonstration concept: simple neural training with animated loss/accuracy and physics-like constraints for teaching.

## 📥 How to use this repo

- Read `report/AI-Philosophy-and-Architecture.pdf` for the full narrative (or the DOCX in `manuscript/`).  
- Use `report/Part_II_Philosophy_and_Physics_Romanova_SI.pdf` for a deeper dive into information–energy–intent budgets and resonance.  
- Refer to `manuscript/AI_Models_Russia_Romanova_SI.docx` for a regional, non-benchmarking overview of Russian AI systems (2023–2025).  
- Use `figures/` when preparing slides or handouts (timeline and architecture diagrams).  
- Once available, run the notebooks in `notebooks/` to regenerate figures and explore architectures programmatically.
