# Artificial Intelligence — Philosophy, Architecture, and Physical Integration

**Author:** S. I. Romanova (2025)  
**Tagline:** The road opens when logic meets light.

## 🧭 Overview
This independent research explores how AI evolves from algorithmic systems into self-organizing, energy-aware cognitive architectures. It connects three threads:

- **Philosophy:** mind, meaning, ethics, agency
- **Architecture:** neural paradigms (ANN, CNN, RNN/LSTM, GAN, Transformer, Diffusion, RL, PINNs, Quantum)
- **Physical integration:** energy, embodiment, resonance, constraints

> Core idea: *from logic to resonance* — computation, energy, and meaning as a single continuum.

## 🧩 Structure
- **Part I — Conceptual Framework & History (1950–2025).** Canonical architectures and milestones.  
- **Part II — Philosophical & Physical Integration.** Cognition ↔ information ↔ energy; alignment of models with physical constraints (PINNs, neuromorphic, quantum).  
- **Appendix — AI Timeline (1950–2025).** Visual chronology of key shifts.

## 🔬 Methods (Author’s conceptual framework)
- **Multilevel AI:** Logical (L), Evolutionary (E), Stochastic (S), Physical (P), Philosophical (Φ)  
- **Formal view:** `AI = f(L, E, S, P, Φ)` and integral axis `∫Φ f(L,E,S,P) dΦ` — mapping micro processes to macro awareness.
- **Architectural lens:** ANN/CNN/RNN/LSTM → GAN → Transformer → Diffusion; hybrids: RL, PINNs, neuromorphic, quantum.
- **Physical alignment:** energy-based constraints, resonance, embodiment; physics-informed residuals in loss.

## 🔎 Results (snapshot)
- A unified **conceptual map** of architectures (1950–2025) and their physical/epistemic assumptions.
- A philosophical synthesis: intelligence as a **resonant field** linking data, energy, and meaning; human–AI **co-learning**.
