Artificial Intelligence — Philosophy, Architecture, and Physical Integration

🧭 Overview

This independent research project by S. I. Romanova (2025) explores the convergence of informatics, physics, and philosophy within the field of Artificial Intelligence.
It examines how AI evolves from algorithmic systems into self-organizing, energy-aware cognitive architectures.

🧩 Structure

Part I — Conceptual Framework
Historical evolution of AI (1950 – 2025); core neural architectures (ANN, CNN, RNN, Transformer, Diffusion, Quantum AI).

Part II — Philosophical and Physical Integration
The correlation between cognition, information energy, and human consciousness; the bridge between physics and synthetic intelligence.

Appendix — AI Timeline (1950 – 2025)
Visual chronology of key discoveries and paradigm shifts.

💡 Research Focus

Exploring the transformation of intelligence from logic to resonance —
where computation, energy, and meaning become one continuum.
