## Case Descriptions

### C-001 — AI Timeline (1950–2025)

**Artifacts:**
- `figures/AI_Timeline_2col.svg`
- `figures/AI_Timeline_2col_1600.png` (for DOCX / slides)

A visual timeline of key milestones in AI development from 1950 to 2025, including:
Turing, Dartmouth, Perceptrons, Backprop, LSTM, LeNet, AlexNet, GANs, Transformers, Diffusion, Quantum / Multimodal tracks.

Used in Part I of the coursework.

### C-002 — Integral AI Architecture Schematic

**Artifacts:**
- `figures/architecture_schematic.svg`
- `figures/architecture_schematic_3200.png` (for DOCX / slides)

A block diagram of an integral AI architecture with lanes for:
data & representation → learning core → evaluation & inference,
and cross-cutting safety / alignment, governance, and physics-informed constraints.

Supports the conceptual framework in Part I and Part II.

### C-003 — Camera-ready Report (Part I)

**Artifact:**
- `report/AI-Philosophy-and-Architecture.pdf`

Camera-ready version of the main coursework:

- Multilevel definition of AI (logical, evolutionary, stochastic, physical, philosophical).
- Historical evolution (1950–2025) and canonical architectures.
- Philosophy of AI and human–AI co-learning.
- Educational / methodological elements and glossary.

Source: `manuscript/AI-Philosophy-and-Architecture.docx`.

### C-004 — Regional AI Systems (Russia, 2023–2025)

**Artifact:**
- `manuscript/AI_Models_Russia_Romanova_SI.docx`

Supplementary, public-safe overview of selected AI systems associated with the Russian ecosystem (2023–2025). Focus:

- modalities (text, code, image, speech),
- typical tasks and ecosystem roles,
- neutral “model card”-style descriptions (no benchmarking or promotion).

Referenced in Part I as a separate regional context note.

---

### C-005 — Part II — Philosophy & Physics (v1)

**Artifacts:**
- `manuscript/Part_II_Philosophy_and_Physics_Romanova_SI.docx`
- `report/Part_II_Philosophy_and_Physics_Romanova_SI.pdf`

Independent manuscript elaborating:

- information, energy, and intent budgets,
- resonance zone as a stability / alignment region,
- physics-informed learning (units, conservation, PINNs, sim-to-real),
- safety and governance as structural constraints, not add-ons,
- Outlook section with directions toward applied physics / aerospace tasks.

Linked from the main coursework as a separate Part II.
